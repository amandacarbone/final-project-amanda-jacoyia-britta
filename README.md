# Thoughtless

Thoughtless helps to answer what is arguably one of the most difficult questions to ever be asked:

**"What do you want for dinner?"**

Using basic information collected from a starting questionnaire specifically designed to be zero pressure and super simple, Thoughtless serves up a random shortlist of recipes (with photos, ingredients, and instructions) to get your mouth watering and your mind relaxing.
